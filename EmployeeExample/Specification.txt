01-initial-specification:
Design a web application that an Human Resources (HR) department could use to
 keep track of employees for a company. It should be designed with United
 States Internal Revenue Service forms, specifically the W-4 form. Information
 should include both the employee's work email and phone, as well as personal
 email and phone. This will only be used by HR members, so no need to limit
 access at this time.


02-usability-improvements:
Feedback from HR users have some useability improvements they would like to
 see implemented in the application:
   1 - Column heading names do not have spaces and are sometimes hard to read.
   2 - ClaimDependantAndOtherCreditsAmount overlaps the value when viewing the
        details of an employee.
   3 - When creating a new employee, Filing Status needs to be input as a
        number. Would be easier to use a dropdown to select the correct values.

03-security:
The business has been growing and there is concern regarding non-HR employees
  having access to sensitive information. A login should be required in order
  to view these records. Registration should only be allowed using work email
  addresses and must be approved by an Administrator. Password requirments
  include the following rules:
    1 - Must be at least 8 characters long.
    2 - Must contain one upper case and one lower case letter.
    3 - Must include one non-alphabetic character.
    4 - Must include one numeric character.

04-security-useability:
Administrators would like to have a way to confirm user accounts without having
  to access the database directly. A page should be added that allows
  registered users confirmation status to be updated. This page should only be
  accessable by users with an Administration role. Normal users should have a
  User role.
