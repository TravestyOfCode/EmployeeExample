Design a web application that an Human Resources (HR) department could use to
 keep track of employees for a company. It should be designed with United
 States Internal Revenue Service forms, specifically the W-4 form. Information
 should include both the employee's work email and phone, as well as personal
 email and phone. This will only be used by HR members, so no need to limit
 access at this time.

Feedback from HR users have some useability improvements they would like to
 see implemented in the application:
   1 - Column heading names do not have spaces and are sometimes hard to read.
   2 - ClaimDependantAndOtherCreditsAmount overlaps the value when viewing the
        details of an employee.
   3 - When creating a new employee, Filing Status needs to be input as a
        number. Would be easier to use a dropdown to select the correct values.
