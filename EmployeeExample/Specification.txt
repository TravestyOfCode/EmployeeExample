Design a web application that an Human Resources (HR) department could use to
 keep track of employees for a company. It should be designed with United
 States Internal Revenue Service forms, specifically the W-4 form. Information
 should include both the employee's work email and phone, as well as personal
 email and phone. This will only be used by HR members, so no need to limit
 access at this time.
